<p><strong>This year we have linked up with ‘Off Out’ to provide our ticketing platform. This will provide visitors with the best possible ticket purchasing facility ever offered by Dronfest. As well as being perfectly secure, ticket buyers will have the option to choose between&nbsp;e-tickets and physical tickets.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Booking Fee</strong></p>

<p>Dronfest is run each year to provide the audience with the best possible artists and bands and to raise as much money as possible for local charities. Year on year, we try to improve the event and this is reflected by the increased audience sizes and monies we have raised. The minimal booking fee goes a little way towards helping to cover these costs. As usual, information regarding the event and the bands/musicians playing will be listed on the website as soon as we can. Please also follow our various social media channels to keep up to date with information about the event. Checkout our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.</p>
