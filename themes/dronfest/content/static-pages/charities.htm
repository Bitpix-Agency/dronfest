<p>1999, aside from being the 25th wedding anniversary of organisers, John &amp; Jackie Aspinall, was the year that John lost one of his good friends, Kenny Mulcrone to Motor Neurone Disease. So, on the day of their party celebrations, buckets were sent around collecting donations to generate some funds for the cause, and approximately £1,000 was raised. A wonderful day was had by all, and that was meant to be the end of it!</p>

<p>However… having received so many positive comments on the events of the day, and with John’s unrelenting passion for organising, The Dronfield Charity Music Festival was born. Apart from showcasing the abundance of talent in the local area, the festival would go on to rahttp://3.8.176.146/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpseo_dashboardise much needed funds for many worthy charities and groups in the area. Having only missed one of the 19 years since inception (2003), the festival has gone from strength to strength welcoming hundreds of performers to grace its stage and has now raised more than £100,000 for charity.</p>

<p>The charities supported each year, along with the total amounts raised each year are as follows below. You will see that the event has steadily grown from year to year and has supported many of the well-known, and other not so well known, local charities over the years. Last year’s donations to various charities saw the total gifted rise to over £100,000!!!</p>
